Motor,,,,,,,,
Pick one,100w 4Nm 220 RPM brushed DC,$85 ,"This is a great price on a seriously strong motor that comes with an encoder. It can mount on the face, the front or the top with M6 screw. This is not a retail, end user motor. The box will contain the motor and literally nothing else.",https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MLZ8W6M/,,,,
,80w 4Nm 160RPM brushed DC - Uxcell,$80 ,This is a more recognizable brand and more popular in the DIY community. It has less power and lower RPMs than the one above for about the same price.,https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0732FFSGS/,,,,

,XY5008 DC DC Buck Converter CC CV 0-50V 8A 400W with IR remote,$18 ,A large LCD screen and the ability to have constant current make this an ideal choice. 8A is more than enough power - I've never exceeded 3A while running the milker.  For an additional $7 you get wifi.,https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003272036569.html,,,,

,One way valves - this price is for (16) of the plastic ones,$7 ,"The check valves are used to control air in / out as well as in the top of the receiver. They can all be the same type if you go with plastic ones.  However, for the solenoids, I like the brass ones to connect directly to the solenoid which reduces joints in the tubes.

Stand,"A milker only requires the shaft of the motor is inline with the cylinder. 4"" wide 1/8"" or 1/4"" aluminum works fine. I usually make compact machines with 16""  and full size thruster / milker combos with 22"". All listed here are 24"" long. Only the front of the cylinder needs to be mounted. If you plan on moving it around or using a stepper, use 1/4"" thick aluminum.",,,,,,,
